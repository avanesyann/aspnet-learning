## Why use underscore in view names?

1. Convention for shared/reusable files

- Files that aren‚Äôt full pages (like layouts, partial views, or components) often get an underscore prefix.
- It makes it clear at a glance: ‚ÄúThis is not meant to be navigated directly as a standalone page.‚Äù

2. To avoid accidental routing

- By default, MVC routing looks for views that match controller actions.
- Files with _ are not expected to be returned directly by controller actions (though technically they can).

3. Organizational clarity

- When you open the Views folder, you can quickly spot the shared/layout/partial files.
- Example: _Layout.cshtml, _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml, _ViewImports.cshtml.

**In short:**

We put an underscore **by convention** to show ‚Äúthis is not a standalone page, but a helper/shared file.‚Äù

*The default location for any partial view is the `Shared` folder.*



## Creating Tables

Anything to do with the database is inside `Data\ApplicationDbContext.cs`

To create a table we create a model, next we create a `DbSet` for that model and do a migration in tha package manager console (add-migration).
After the migration we type `update-database` so that the entity core will check if there are any migrations that have not been pushed to the db.
(EF keeps track of added migrations in the `__EFMigrationsHistory` table)

**Whenever anything has to be updated in a database we add a migration.**

*`SaveChanges()` sends all pending changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to the database.*



## Seeding

Seeding means automatically inserting initial data into your database when it‚Äôs first created or migrated.

Think of it like planting default values ‚Äî categories, roles, admin users, countries, etc. ‚Äî so your app starts with some data instead of an empty database.


### How to Seed Data in EF Core

#### Method 1: Model-based seeding (via `OnModelCreating`)

1. Open your `ApplicationDbContext.cs`

Add this inside your class:

```
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

    modelBuilder.Entity<Category>().HasData(
        new Category { Id = 1, Name = "Electronics" },
        new Category { Id = 2, Name = "Books" },
        new Category { Id = 3, Name = "Games" }
    );
}
```

üí° You must specify the Id values manually for seeding, because EF Core needs to track them during migrations.

Now, open the Package Manager Console and run:

`Add-Migration SeedCategories`
`Update-Database`


EF Core will detect the new seed data and insert it into your Categories table automatically.
